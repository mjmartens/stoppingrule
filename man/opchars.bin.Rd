\title{Operating Characteristics Function (Binary Data)}
\usage{
opchars.bin(rule, p, tau = NULL, A = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{rule}{A \code{rule.bin} object calculated by \code{calc.rule.bin()} function}

\item{p}{The toxicity probability}

\item{tau}{Length of observation period}

\item{A}{Length of the enrollment period.}
}
\value{
A list containing the toxicity probability \code{p}, and the corresponding rejection probability and expected number of events. If \code{tau} and \code{A} are also specified, the expected number of enrolled patients and the expected calendar time at the point of stopping/study end are also included.
}
\description{
Internal workhorse function to calculate operating characteristics for a given stopping rule and toxicity probability
