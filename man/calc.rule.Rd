\title{Stopping Rule Calculation}
\usage{
calc.rule(ns, p0, type, param = NULL, alpha, iter = 50)
}
\arguments{
\item{ns}{A vector of sample sizes at which sequential testing is performed}

\item{p0}{The toxicity rate under the null hypothesis}

\item{type}{The method used for constructing the stopping rule. Choices include a Pocock test ("Pocock"), a Wang-Tsiatis test ("WT"), the Bayesian beta-binomial method ("BB") proposed by Geller et al. 2003, the Bayesian beta-binomial method ("CC") proposed by Chen and Chaloner 2006, a truncated SPRT ("SPRT"), and a maximized SPRT ("MaxSPRT").}

\item{param}{Extra parameter(s) needed for certain stopping rule methods. For binomial Wang-Tsiatis tests, this is the Delta parameter. For Bayesian beta-binomial model, this is the pair of hyperparameters (a,b) for the beta prior on the toxicity rate. For Chen and Chaloner's method, this is the pair of hyperparameters (a,b) for the beta prior on the toxicity rate, the targeted alternative toxicity rate p1, and the threshold nu for the posterior probability that p > p1. For modified SPRT, this is the targeted alternative toxicity rate p1.}

\item{alpha}{The desired type I error / false positive rate for the stopping rule}

\item{iter}{The number of iterations used to search for the boundary}
}
\value{
A matrix with two columns: the sample sizes \code{ns} and their corresponding rejection boundaries

Calculate a stopping rule for safety monitoring

# Binomial Pocock test in 50 patient cohort at 10\% level, expected toxicity rate of 20\%
calc.rule(ns=1:50,p0=0.20,type="Pocock",alpha=0.10)
